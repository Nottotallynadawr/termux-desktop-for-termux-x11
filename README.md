Alright, Let's just get this straight, these are just some **dotfiles** & **scripts**, which will help you to setup a graphical environment in **termux**. I've tried to make it *as easy as possible* to setup a beautiful ***linux desktop on your android device*** with termux, So follow the steps and you'll end up making it look like this - <br />

|Openbox WM|Another Style|

Lets start from the beginning... <br />

### Why This Does Exist ?

Termux-Desktop Is A Great Project And I Like It! And I Made A Fork Of It To Try And Make It In-date By Adding Arch-Craft Themes (WIP) And I Also Modified It So I Can 
Run It In Termux-x11,


### What is termux?

Termux is an *Android terminal emulator* and **Linux environment** app that works directly with **no rooting** or setup required. A minimal base system is installed automatically - additional packages are available using the *PKG/APT package manager*. More [Here](https://termux.com/)... <br />

### How To install termux?

You can install termux from termux github or from f-droid. <br />

- Download from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/) <br />

### Termux:x11 & Termux:Api

- Termux:Api F-droid : https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.api/
- Termux:x11 : https://github.com/termux/termux-x11/actions Or https://github.com/termux/termux-x11/releases
- Note: the first one Link To Download Termux:x11 App Requires A Github Account To Download The Files
- An Thing. if you have installed termux from github you also have to install termux api from github, the same applys to fdroid termux, if you install termux from github and termux api from f-droid, guess what? termux api fails to install because It Simply Conflicts.

More information about installation is [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Main_Page) <br />

### Preparation

Install `Termux` & `Termux:API` Also `Termux:x11` on your phone. It's recommended to install *Termux API* application as many desktop elements are dependent on it.

> This setup is created and tested on :
> 
> Device - **Redmi Pad** <br />
> Android - **Android 14, HyperOS 1.0** <br />
> CPU Type - **aarch64** <br />
> CPU - **Mediatek Helio G99** <br />
> RAM - **4 GB**

### Installation

After installing both applications above, open `Termux` and follow the steps below -

- Update termux packages and install `git`
```
pkg upgrade && pkg install git
```

- Clone this repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Nottotallynadawr/termux-desktop-for-termux-x11.git
```

> **Warning** : I'm assuming that you're doing this on a fresh termux install. If not, I'll suggest you to do so. However the `setup.sh` script backup every file it replace, It's still recommended that you manually backup your files in order to avoid conflicts. <br />

- Change to cloned directory and run `setup.sh` with *--install* option
```
cd termux-desktop-for-termux-x11
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh --install
```
- Or Let Me Just Make It Simpler
  ```

  pkg upgrade -y && pkg install git -y && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Nottotallynadawr/termux-desktop-for-termux-x11.git && cd termux-desktop-for-termux-x11 && chmod +x setup.sh && bash setup.sh --install

  ```

> If script `setup.sh` fails during package installation (due to network issues), you can re-execute it again.

- During installation You Might See power10k Configure. if your screen gets randomly Rotated, you better go to termux NOW! -

That's it. `Termux Desktop` is installed successfully. *Restart Termux* and enter `startdesktop` command to start Termux X11 And Desktop And enter `startdesktopvirgl` if You Want A Virgl Hardware Accelerated Envoirment. <br />

> Do note that the VirGL environment is a bit unstable 

### Uninstall (WIP)

If you ever want to uninstall Termux Desktop, just run `setup.sh` with *--uninstall* option. Just keep the `setup.sh` script and delete the cloned repository to save space. I'll create a separate uninstaller script later. The command below will remove all the packages and delete all the config files it installed, including the changes you've made. So, Be careful there...
```
./setup.sh --uninstall
```
